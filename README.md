  <h2>281 Project 2 Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A web API or Application Programming Interface is an API accessed using the HTTP protocol</li>
    <li>Web APIs often deliver data formatted as JSON</li>
    <li>A web API can be accessed programmatically using JavaScript</li>
    <li>The API documentation must first be consulted in order to understand how the API works and what it returns</li>
    <li>Some web APIs are public, and others require an access key.  Flickr offers several public APIs</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: This work is not my own. I e-mailed Prof. Hennessy about not being able to create my project 2 repository. The next day I saw in my repos: "project-2-jchacko15". I created my own repo with my Github username and imported the files from this 'jchacko15' repo. I haven't yet checked if this is another student's work or the source code. Please do not give me credit for this assignment yet.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>I will update this when I ensure all work on this repo is my own. Thank you. **04-28-2020 20:05**</li>
      <li>Requirement 4 has been done by myself **05-08-2020 19:30**</li>
