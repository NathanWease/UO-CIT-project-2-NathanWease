  <h2>281 Project 2 Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Creating a function that reverses the letters and words in a sentence.</li>
    <li>Flickr Image Gallery.</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: This work is not my own. I e-mailed Prof. Hennessy about not being able to create my project 2 repository. The next day I saw in my repos: "project-2-jchacko15". I created my own repo with my Github username and imported the files from this 'jchacko15' repo. I haven't yet checked if this is another student's work or the source code. Please do not give me credit for this assignment yet. I will update this when I ensure all work on this repo is my own. Thank you. **04-28-2020 20:05**
